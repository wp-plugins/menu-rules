An extension of the menu system with context-based rules and a flexible framework to write your own.

== Description ==

In WordPress there's no way to apply context to the menu system. Menu Rules solves this problem and gives you a framework to write your own menu extensions.

= Example usage =

You have an e-commerce website that has a custom post type called 'products'. You have a page that lists products which is listed in your main menu. A user visits the page and the menu item becomes 'active'. You click through to a product and the menu item loses its active state. This is how to fix it with menu rules:

1. [Install](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/menu-rules/installation/) the Menu Rules plugin
1. Add a menu rule
1. Give it a meaningful name in the title field. This is just for administration purposes
1. In the conditions field enter `is_singular( 'product' )`
1. Choose *Emulate current page as a child but do not create a menu item.* as the menu rule
1. Find your products page in the menu dropdown
1. Hit publish

= Extending Menu Rules =

1. Create a class that extends `Menu_Rules_Handler` and includes a `handler` method.
1. Write your custom functionality
1. Register your class using `add_action( 'plugins_loaded', create_function( '', 'Menu_Rules::register( "Your_Menu_Rule_Class" );' ) );`

Built-in rules are found in `menu-rules/rules/`
